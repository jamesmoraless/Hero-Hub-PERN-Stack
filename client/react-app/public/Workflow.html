            <h2>Steps for Handling DMCA Notices</h2>
            <h3>Receiving the DMCA Notice:</h3>
            <p>DMCA complaints should be sent to the designated email address (e.g., jmorale6@uwo.ca). Ensure that the complaint includes all necessary information, such as details of the copyrighted work, specifics of the infringement, and the complainant's contact information.</p>

            <h3>Reviewing the Complaint:</h3>
            <p>Upon receiving a DMCA notice, the SM should first verify its validity. Ensure that the complaint includes a physical or electronic signature, identification of the copyrighted work, identification of the material claimed to be infringing, contact information of the complainant, a statement of good faith belief, and a statement that the information in the notice is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complainant is authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.</p>

            <h3>Takedown Process:</h3>
            <p>If the complaint is valid, use the admin tools to promptly remove or disable access to the infringing material. The specific steps to do this will depend on the admin tools provided on your platform.</p>

            <h3>Notifying the Content Provider:</h3>
            <p>After taking down the content, inform the content provider of the action taken and provide details of the DMCA notice. Include information about how to file a counter-notice if they believe the takedown was a mistake.</p>

            <h3>Handling Counter-Notices:</h3>
            <p>If a counter-notice is received, review it to ensure it includes all required elements. If the counter-notice is valid, restore the removed content unless you receive a notice from the complainant that they have filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the content provider from engaging in infringing activity related to the material on the site.</p>

            <h3>Documentation and Record-Keeping:</h3>
            <p>Maintain records of all received DMCA notices and actions taken in response. This is crucial for legal purposes and for tracking repeat infringers.</p>

            <h3>Dealing with Repeat Infringers:</h3>
            <p>Implement a policy to handle repeat infringers, which may include suspending or terminating their accounts.</p>
